    <h2>Mission of the Center</h2>
    <p>To serve as a coordination and communication vehicle for biomedical informatics (BMI) educational and research activities, and resources. Build new collaborations pertinent to both academia and industry by horizontal integration of expertise, resources, and users under one umbrella organization to facilitate effective utilization of BMI resources and expertise in the realms of all types of health research.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div id="Vision" class="card">
    <h2>Vision of the Center</h2>
    <p>Under the co-direction of Babu Guda, PhD, professor in the UNMC Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy and Ann Fruhling, PhD, professor of Interdisciplinary Informatics within UNO's College of Information Science & Technology, CBIRI’s vision is to be recognized as a national leader in providing biomedical informatics (BMI) expertise and resources to promote and advance basic, clinical, translational, and public health research. ​</p>

	<h2>Center for Biomedical Informatics Research & Innovation</h2>

<p>CBIRI intends to quickly link faculty to the biomedical informatics resources and expertise they need.  The center aims to open doors for additional biomedical informatics research and discoveries; sharing and collaboration of personnel and resources across campuses and disciplines; and provide the support to compete for a new Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant.  The center will allow strategic planning, improve communication and coordination and streamline collaboration opportunities for all types of activities related to biomedical informatics, including bioinformatics, clinical informatics and public health informatics.</p>
<p>The term “biomedical informatics” is used differently in various settings. For the purpose of this Center and proposal, we define biomedical informatics as a collection of disciplines that include bioinformatics and systems biology (using biomolecular data), clinical and health informatics, and bioimaging informatics.</p>

    <div id="Goals" class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Strategically position the University of Nebraska to advance from a regional leader in biomedical informatics to a nationally recognized program by actively engaging faculty in developing and expanding unique expertise, growing faculty focused on biomedical informatics, and training students to accelerate biomedical discoveries.​</li>
        <li>Develop and disseminate training and outreach activities, such as seminars, vendor-sponsored workshops, mini-symposiums and short non-credit courses related to biomedical informatics to enable faculty and students to collaborate with BMI experts. ​</li>
        <li>Develop a platform for sharing personnel and resources across sub-disciplines and campuses, including the acquisition and distribution of BMI data analysis software by leveraging collective bargaining and group licensing.​</li>
        <li>Identify and develop research infrastructure that allows BMI to adapt to the rapidly changing needs of diverse disciplines.​</li>
        <li>Increase the number and variety of services, contracts, and grants that will sustain and grow the Center in the long term. In particular, the expertise and collaborations within CBIRI will be leveraged at UNO to compete for a new COBRE grant focused on the gut microbiome.​</li>
        </ul>

	<div id="CBIRI Structure" class="card">
		<h2>CBIRI Structure</h2>
		<p>CBIRI will be administered by two Co-Directors, a steering committee, an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and an External Advisory Committee (EAC).  Policies and procedures will be developed by the steering committee, which will meet quarterly.   Key strategic goals and plans will be developed through broadly based input from internal and external advisory committee members. The IAC and EAC are expected to meet on an annual basis with the steering committee members.</p>
